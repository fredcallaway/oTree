    <p> In this HIT you will play {{ session.config.num_games }} two-player
    games with many different real people. In each game, you will see a table
    like the one below. You have to spend at least {{Constants.min_time}} seconds on each game. The other person will choose a column in the same way.
    These two decision select one cell from the table, which determines the points
    you will each receive.


    <div id="target1" class="target"></div>
    <br>
    <p>
    In each cell, there are two numbers. The first (orange) number is the
    number of points you get, and the second (blue) number is the number of
    points the other person gets. These points will determine the bonus
    payment you receive at the end of the HIT.
    For example, if you choose the third row and the other person chooses
    the second column, you would receive 4 points and she or he would receive
    8 points, as shown below.

    <div id="target2" class="target"></div>
    <br>
    <p> After each game, you will be matched with a <b>new person</b> and play a <b>new game</b>.

    <p> Before beginning to play, you must pass a quiz to demonstrate that you
        understand the rules. You must pass all three pages of the quiz before
        you can continue.
